# Market Anomaly Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to detect anomalies in financial market data in near real-time. It focuses on identifying unusual patterns that could signify market events, using historical stock data from APIs like AlphaVantage, Yahoo Finance, and IEX Cloud.

## Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the anomaly detection.
- `data/`: (TODO) Contains the data files used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: (TODO) Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.

## Setup
To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/market-anomaly-detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd market-anomaly-detection`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
To run the anomaly detection script, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the `src/` directory.
2. Run the script: `python3 anom.py`

## Progress
The project has implemented data acquisition, preprocessing, and an initial anomaly detection model using Isolation Forest. The next steps include enhancing data visualization, model tuning, and evaluation.
